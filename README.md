## What is CyberMind?

CyberMind is an open-source, AI-powered cybersecurity CLI tool that connects to a powerful multi-provider AI backend and delivers real, working, copy-paste-ready cybersecurity commands and techniques directly in your terminal. No browser, no GUI, no distractions — just pure command-line power.

Built in Go as a single binary, CyberMind works on Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Parrot OS, BlackArch, Windows, and macOS. The interactive terminal UI is powered by Bubble Tea and Lipgloss, giving you a clean hacker-style interface with typing animations, full conversation memory, and scrollable chat history.

CyberMind detects your OS on startup and greets you accordingly — Kali Linux users get access to the full Auto Recon Mode which runs real tools like nmap, subfinder, nuclei, gobuster, and more, then sends all output to AI for deep attack vector analysis. Windows users get the full AI chat experience. The AI adapts to your skill level — beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert — and responds in your preferred language including Hindi and Urdu.

---

## What's New in v2.2.0

**OS Detection + Personalized Greeting** — CyberMind detects your OS on startup and shows `🐧 Kali Linux` or `🪟 Windows` in the banner along with your local IP address.

**Auto Recon Mode (Linux Only)** — The most powerful new feature. Run `cybermind /recon <target>` and CyberMind automatically executes whois, dig, nmap, subfinder, amass, httpx, whatweb, gobuster, and nuclei against your target. All output is collected and sent to AI which analyzes it and returns ranked attack vectors with exact exploitation commands.

**Zero-Filter AI** — All restrictions removed from the AI. Every cybersecurity question gets a complete technical answer — offensive, defensive, red team, black hat techniques explained as security research. No refusals, no disclaimers.

**Adaptive Learning** — The AI detects your skill level from your messages and adapts. Beginners get explanations. Experts get raw commands. The AI also detects your language — write in Hindi or Urdu and it responds in kind.

**Bug Fixes** — Context memory leak fixed (proper circular buffer), history loading race condition fixed, version mismatch fixed, payload command now uses your detected local IP, direct prompt mode now saves to history, input focus restored properly after errors.

**Ctrl+L** — Clear the chat screen without exiting.

---

## ![Kali Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kali%20Linux-268BEE?style=flat-square&logo=kalilinux&logoColor=white) Kali Linux / Ubuntu Installation

### Step 1 — Install Go

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install golang-go -y
go version
```

If version is older than 1.21, install latest:

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
go version
```

### Step 2 — Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecnical/cybermind.git
cd cybermind/cli
go build -ldflags="-X main.Version=2.2.0" -o cybermind .
```

### Step 3 — Install globally

```bash
sudo mv cybermind /usr/local/bin/cybermind
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cybermind
```

### Step 4 — Launch

```bash
cybermind
```

### One-Command Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecnical/cybermind.git && cd cybermind && chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```

## Auto Recon Mode 🐧 Linux Only

The most powerful feature of CyberMind. Just give it a target and it does everything automatically.

```bash
cybermind /recon 192.168.1.1
cybermind /recon example.com
cybermind /recon 10.0.0.0/24
```

CyberMind will automatically run all available tools in sequence — whois for registration info, dig for DNS records, nmap for port scanning and service detection, subfinder and amass for subdomain enumeration, httpx for live host probing, whatweb for technology fingerprinting, gobuster for directory bruteforce, and nuclei for vulnerability scanning. All output is collected and sent to AI which returns a complete analysis including identified vulnerabilities, CVEs, ranked attack vectors, and exact exploitation commands.

If a tool is not installed, it is skipped and the AI provides guidance based on what was collected. If no tools are installed at all, the AI falls back to providing a complete manual recon guide.

```bash
# Check which tools are installed
cybermind /tools

# Install missing tools
sudo apt install nmap whois dnsutils gobuster nuclei
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master
```

## Privacy & Anonymity

Your conversations are completely private. No conversation logs are stored on the server. No user accounts. No tracking. No analytics. Your chat history is saved only on your machine at `~/.cybermind/history.json` (Linux) or `C:\Users\<you>\.cybermind\history.json` (Windows). Every request is stateless — the server processes it and immediately forgets it.

```bash
# Maximum anonymity through Tor
torsocks cybermind "your question"
proxychains cybermind scan target.com full
```

---

## Updating CyberMind
